            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <h2>1963</h2>
            <p>Our story begins in New York in 1963. Inner city kids from underprivileged backgrounds face limited
                opportunities and, often, underperforming school systems. Students look for role models and support to
                achieve their aspirations.</p>
            <p>New Yorker Michael Osheowitz is committed to the vision that ambition and intelligence – not zip
                codes or
                skin colour – should determine who succeeds. At age 24, he founds Sponsors for Educational
                Opportunity
                (SEO) as a mentoring programme to help underserved students gain admission to competitive colleges
                and
                universities.</p>
